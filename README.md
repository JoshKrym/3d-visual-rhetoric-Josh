# 3d-visual-rhetoric-Josh

## Introduction
I would like to attempt to recreate my visual rhetorics project on fantasy using blender. I have never used Blender before, and I would like to learn how to use it. While I don’t expect my final result to look very good, I believe that it would be a great learning experience for me. I would find existing 3d models online, and insert them into the scene, and possibly modify them, if I need to modify them. While I don’t think that this will allow me to master blender by the end of the project, I hope that it will give me a good foundation to build off, that will allow me to eventually master it with future projects. This will also allow me to think about the differences between presenting a 2d environment and a 3d environment, and the way that someone would explore it. I don’t know how to use blender and therefore, don’t really know what would be too much of an aspirational goal vs what is simple to do. I am just going to try and do my best to create something that I find interesting.


## Baseline Goals
For a minimum grade of B, all projects for this unit must…
- Use arrangement, size, color, visual rhythm, and/or contrast to focus and guide viewers' attention.
    - Use the reflection to clarify your compositional choices and goals (e.g. design hierarchy)
- Have a clear message or intervention that you can articulate in your reflection
    - If not using words, clarify your message and this choice in the reflection
- If including words, choose a font that matches the style/tone of your piece
- Credit all assets correctly, including attribution (creator names) where required
- Use at least 3 layers
- Use at least 1 tool beyond select and move
## Aspirational Goals
To target (but not guarantee) a grade above a B, the best projects for this unit may…

- Use multiple design strategies in ways that compliment each other (whether to reinforce a single shared focus or to add nuance / surprise down the hierarchy)
- Refer to readings in explaining your design choices
- Be bright and bold to make your work pop and draw the eye
- Be subtle and crafty to make your work reveal itself only gradually
- Consider accessibility in your design, e.g. through, color palettes designed for people with colorblindness, high contrast for people with visual impairments, etc
- Include a way to find out more information about topic of argument (e.g. QR code)
- Merge 2 Designs in a way as to make them unreconizable as either.
- Use more than 3 tools beyond select and move that are new to you
    - e.g. Collaborate with the machine by using automated tools/filters/effects (gradients, blur, etc)
    - e.g. Use layer masks / blend modes for non-destructive extraction, saturation, cross-fades (ie. to seamlessly blend images from disparate sources), etc
- etc.

- Demonstrate through feedback that someone looking at your piece can accurately articulate your message/argument
- Demonstrate through feedback that someone looking at your piece can accurately describe your intended audience
